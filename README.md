# Grade_Point_Prediction_Using_Linear_Regression

Project: Student Grade-Point Prediction using Linear Regression

Author: Aviral

Date: 16th April 2021

Overview of the project:
We have datasets of two schools where a record has been maintained with informations ranging from multiples parameters which affect the grades of the students.
I have performed data cleaning,feature engineering,EDA and data modelling which could predict the students grade with very low error using Linear Regression. 

Files:
Grade_point.ipynb - The Jupyter notebook where EDA and Modelling has been done
student-por - dataset1
student-mat - dataset2

Usage recommendations:

The code will easily run in any version of Jupyter notebooks.
Libraries which need to be downloaded are:
pandas
seaborn
numpy
matplotlib
sklearn
